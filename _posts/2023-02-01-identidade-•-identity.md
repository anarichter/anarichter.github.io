é como se aquele caderno 
<br> e aquelas anotações
<br> não fossem minhas
<br> eu reconhecia a letra, sua forma arredondada
<br> ou alongada, quando com pressa
<br> (não pela necessidade de fazer outra coisa
<br> mas para registrar tudo aquilo
<br> que logo poderia ser esquecido)
<br> e não se entregar às distrações)
<br> mas as palavras me eram estranhas
<br> o jeito de escrever me era estranho
<br> ao seguir com os olhos pelas linhas preenchidas
<br> – era outra pessoa quem as narrava?
<br> eu me via imersa em um momento suspenso, confuso
<br> olhava ao meu redor
<br> buscando estabelecer vínculos com o real 
<br> mas alguma força
<br> arrastava-me para o centro de um redemoinho 
<br> que embaralhava palavras
<br> pensamentos 
<br> e memórias
<br>
<br>

then, a burst of consciousness hit me:
<br> was I grafting his identity?
<br> that thought startled me,
<br> for I realised that I was in the middle of it:
<br> 
<br> if that was really happening,
<br> it was already happening
<br> – unintentionally,
<br> inadvertently
<br> 
<br> what would that make of me?
<br> 
<br> with respect to him,
<br> I certainly felt a bit like a thief
<br> but as far as I was concerned:
<br> was I a numb soul until that moment?
<br> 
<br> that was the second thought
<br> in a very short time interval
<br> that frightened me
<br>
<br>

when the alarm clock went off, i woke up right away, startled. i opened my eyes as wide as i could, but it did not matter: for a few seconds, i had no idea where i was (or why i was there). i knew i would eventually realise it, but in that little while, i was floating in the vacuum – this is how it felt. the difference from past experiences is that it lasted longer, and i wasn’t scared. i set out to stay calm, to try to recall things rationally. then, the word – the only word – that came to my mind was ‘universe.’ whether it felt like i was part of it or i was it myself, i could not say; my memory came back all at once. it was a brief amnesia, and it felt good.

i was crazy — but i did not know it — now i do
<br> what i wrote — was written in a different language
<br> one — one cannot understand
<br> but those words — they were my best attempt
<br> my best attempt — to make sense of this
<br> to make me be <br>(understood)
<br>

<br>are these moments feelings?

o potencial do meu ser / estava naquelas imagens
<br> <s>perdidas</s> / desaparecidas / desaparecidas do universo
<br> real / e do das possibilidades / e promessas
<br> promessas de que tudo ficaria bem
<br> aquilo tudo era meu / eu 
<br> e agora <s>ninguém veria</s> / ninguém jamais teria contato
<br> com o que ainda era / para o mundo / desconhecido
<br> partes de mim
<br>
