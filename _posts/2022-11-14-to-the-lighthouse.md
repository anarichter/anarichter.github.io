<span style="font-size:14px;font-weight:lighter">(i was reading Virginia Woolf and "inspired" by the book.)</span>

Having walked all the path to that curious park by checking the GPS on my mobile, I now thought it was enough: I could finish the way on my own. And I was sure I had to go up the wide and long stairway to reach my destination (it would be like the curtains opening for a spectacle). 

But instead, as I climbed the stairs, I was becoming less and less certain that this was the direction I was supposed to take. Then, looking up at the highest point of the stairway doubting my once-conviction, there I saw them: the couple; there I saw it: the most passionate kiss.

Watching this scene (indeed it felt like a spectacle), I imagined that this couple had just reunited – after all, we were near the station, the station to which I, myself, was going, and which I had mistakenly believed, just a moment ago, to be at the top of the stairs, behind them.

(Was my being drawn to their story related to my own? Half suspended in time and space, wandering without really having anywhere to go or to go back to, the mind becomes more attuned to others’ ordinary emotions – ordinary, not banal, emotions.)

Suddenly, then, I got closer to their truth: I realized what was really happening: it was a goodbye kiss.

I slowly climbed two or three more steps – not looking at the immediate next step, but at them – and their desolation, and longing for the deep connection their love created, seemed to be screaming into the blue sky above our heads. But the reality was, each one had a foot in their own world, for there, in each one’s own world, was where each one belonged. It was a goodbye kiss.

He went down the stairs; she stayed there. They kept eye contact for as long as they could. 

I reached the top of the stairway, which opened up to an impressively wide horizon. There, turning 360 degrees around my feet, I saw nothing. No sign of the station. Just a void; the void left behind by the most passionate kiss.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

***

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

<!-- 
earlier this year, i stayed at a strange place for a few weeks, detached from everything around.
<br> somewhat drifting away from myself in the midst of it all, i found a special bookshelf.
<br> it involved me in an exciting, secret and personal way at once.
<br>
<br> as the days passed, holding different books in my hands, i started to look around and barely understand how that room was not my own:
<br>
<br> i could have taken those picture, i could have chosen those furnitures, i could have watered those plants since they arrived, i could have been the neighbours' neighbour.

<blockquote>
    then, a burst of consciousness hit me:
    <br> was I grafting his identity?
    <br> that thought startled me,
    <br> for I realized that I was in the middle of it:
    <br> 
    <br> if that was really happening,
    <br> it was already happening
    <br> – unintentionally, 
    <br> inadvertently
    <br> 
    <br> what would that make of me?
    <br> 
    <br> with respect to him,
    <br> I certainly felt a bit like a thief
    <br> but as far as I was concerned:
    <br> was I a numb soul until that moment?
    <br> 
    <br> that was the second thought
    <br> in a very short time interval
    <br> that frightened me
</blockquote>
