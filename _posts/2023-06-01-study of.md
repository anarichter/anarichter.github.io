Your smile makes me smile. Sometimes just because it looks sweet, so that is how I automatically react. Often the reason why you are smiling makes me smile: it is special because I realize that whatever led to your smile, it would hardly have been first noticed or perceived by anyone else – and that makes me smile, too.

You have a lot of convictions; you can articulate things incredibly naturally. I find it strange, because this mental clarity is foreign to me. But you also know how to pose questions and you point to unanswered things. I, too, can pose questions – tons of them – but unlike you, I cannot point to unanswered things in contrast to those that have been.<!--You calm me down. I do not know why. Even when you seem to be impatient, you calm me down.-->
