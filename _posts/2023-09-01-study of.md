​where have you been?
<br>– ​i close my eyes and wonder,
<br>do you ever think of me?
<br><br>
Your smile makes me smile. Sometimes just because it looks sweet, so that is how I automatically react. Often the reason why you are smiling makes me smile: it is special because I realise that whatever led to your smile, it would hardly have been first noticed or perceived by anyone else – and that makes me smile, too.
<br><br>
You have a lot of convictions; you can articulate things incredibly naturally. I find it strange, because this mental clarity is foreign to me. But you also know how to pose questions and you point to unanswered things. I, too, can pose questions – tons of them – but unlike you, I cannot point to unanswered things in contrast to those that have been.
