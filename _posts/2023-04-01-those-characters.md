If a verb to express what this is is to be picked, 
<br> then the verb is ‘to haunt’.
<br> The image of that man, laborer (“a person doing unskilled manual work for wages”), father, perhaps the owner of that small property where we found ourselves, built and maintained exclusively with their own hands, haunts me. but this verb seems to imply that he is somewhat responsible for the terror.
<br> The image haunts me, and it is within myself that the discomfort lies. for all he did was to ask, humbly, innocently, if we could help. He did not need to justify it. We could see it. But we could not.
<br> How in such an encounter, anchored in mutual respect, can you look someone in the eye and say, bluntly, ‘We cannot help you’? 
<br> As I try to make sense of that moment, materialized now in a distant memory, it chokes me. Still, it is not our powerlessness, powerlessness in the face of a strong predicament, in the face of a noble, sad gaze, that haunts me...

I was really touched by her. 
<br> Her stare was deep and grave; still it was not only about her eyes. I could read it in her face: all the strength overflowing from the pores, demarcating its expression lines. I was touched by her past, completely unknown to me.
<br> I don’t understand clearly what kind of emotion she imparted to me, but it was powerful. In each blink of her eyes I could see a different struggle, and I knew that the suffering was there – hidden, perhaps, but there. 
<br> I imagined she endured every battle with pride, as if it was not allowed for her to cry, to show how hard those battles were; to slow down. It was not about succeeding, because it was not about success. It was not about recognition neither. It was simply about living an honorable life.

We had this peculiar, interesting relationship in which one could never really understand what the other meant. Deep down, we both knew that, but it didn't matter. I suppose we esteemed each other's life stance, and for some reason, felt safe in that bond (our, if formal, almost solemn). We kept exchanging observations about life now and then as if life itself made sense.
