<strong>02.08.</strong> 
I remember the date because I remember noticing that guy’s intention to ask, <i>What day is it again?</i>—without him saying a word, just perceiving it from my peripheral vision. That’s how unwelcome his sudden presence in the room—sitting right across from me—was. At least it wouldn’t last long. But anyway, who let him in? When he finally decided to disturb me (and he did), all I did—besides getting annoyed—was make a brief detour from my own world (filled with genuine problems, as we shall see), barely acknowledging him: <i>2 August</i>.

[ three years later, they got married. ] <!-- <br> Incidentally, on 2 August, as the marriage certificate attests. -->
