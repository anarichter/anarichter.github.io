​where have you been?
<br> – ​i close my eyes and wonder,
<br> ​do you ever think of me?

Your smile makes me smile. Sometimes just because it looks sweet, so that is how I automatically react. Often the reason why you are smiling makes me smile: it is special because I realize that whatever led to your smile, it would hardly have been first noticed or perceived by anyone else – and that makes me smile, too.

You have a lot of convictions; you can articulate things incredibly naturally. I find it strange, because this mental clarity is foreign to me. But you also know how to pose questions and you point to unanswered things. I too can pose questions – tons of them – but unlike you, I cannot point to unanswered things in contrast to those that have been.

You calm me down. I do not know why. Even when you seem to be impatient, you calm me down.-->

o potencial do meu ser estava naquelas fotos
<br> perdidas... não--desaparecidas
<br> desaparecidas do universo
<br> real
<br> e das possibilidades
<br> e potencialidades
<br> e promessas
<br> --promessas de que tudo ficaria bem

eu tenho tido flashbacks
<br> recortes de momentos e experiências
<br>  que cruzam, repentinamente, minha mente,
<br> e assusto-me
<br> com o inesperado
<br> com a fidelidade desse recorte ao que foi real
<br> com a presença de detalhes
<br> e a precisão dos detalhes
<br> não há nostalgia; não dá tempo de criar esse vínculo com a memória.
<br> são imagens de um filme
<br> e assusto-me

aquilo tudo era meu
<br> era eu

i was crazy but i did not know it. now i do
<br> what i wrote, was written in a different language
<br> one one cannot understand
<br> but they were my best attempt to make sense of this,
<br> to make me be understood.
