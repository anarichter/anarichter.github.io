# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

# Should I explain myself? Should I explain something?

hi, there – I'm Ana!
<br> olá – eu sou a Ana!

<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:lighter"> 
the idea of creating this website came about as a coding exercise – I wanted to learn a bit about GitHub – and I ended up designing it to include my resume and things that interest me – in a fairly random fashion: reflections in English and Portuguese • pictures • references • whatnots

A ideia de criar este site surgiu como um exercício de ti (queria aprender um pouco sobre o GitHub) e acabei projetando-o para incluir meu currículo e coisas que me interessam: reflexões, fotos, referências, tudo o mais-->
