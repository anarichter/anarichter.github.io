hi, there – I'm Ana! &emsp; <br> olá – eu sou a Ana!

<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:lighter"> 
the idea of creating this website came about as a coding exercise – wanted to learn a bit about GitHub – and I ended up designing it to include my resume and things that interest me (progressively / in a fairly random fashion / under construction): notes in <a href="/blog/tag/english/">English</a> and <a href="/blog/tag/português">Portuguese</a> • <a href="/bookshelf">references</a> • <a href="/cards/photos">pictures</a> • whatnots

<!-- <span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:lighter"> 
But this is a page under construction, so please, bear with me :-) -->
