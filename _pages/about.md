# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

# Here I should tell the world about myself. Maybe explain myself somehow. Or, then, explain something.

# Writing about.. about whatnot?

hi, there – I'm Ana! 

<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:lighter">
Creating this website came as a coding exercise (to start learning a little about GitHub) and I ended up designing it to include my CV and things that interest me – such as reflections, pictures, references...

<span style="font-size:15px;font-weight:lighter">
But this is a page under construction, so please, bear with me :-)
